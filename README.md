Hey, I'm Aletris Pinkroot (@AletrisPinkroot)! <br>
I'm an indie-electronic-country-pop artist, and am also a huge nerd :). I mainly work in Javascript/Typescript and Python, but also do a lot of work in Java. <br>
I'm currently learning React, cause it seems cool. <br>
Feel free to get to me at contact@aletrispinkroot.com :)
